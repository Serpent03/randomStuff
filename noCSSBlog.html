        At a time when people thought that the Earth was flat and that man would take flight in a 
        million years, there was a visionary by the name of Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky - born in 
        a small village named Izhevskoe, in Russia.
        <br><br>
        This man would later go on to design what is today known as the "rocket equation", and lay down the groundwork as the 
        father of modern rocketry. However despite all his works, they were still theories, untested by the harshness of gravity and 
        doubted by the mind of man.

        Sergie Korolev himself - all of them out to prove that orbit can be achieved; and that Tsiolkovsky was correct a century ago.

        October 4, 1957 - was an ordinary day for many people. People woke up, toiled around, went to work in the morning - 
        and it was a perfectly normal day, and that's all it would have been - had it not been for the <i>Sputnik</i>. A shiny, metallic
        sphere with a weight of 86 kilograms - fitted with basic radio and scientific instruments, this 23 inch spherical satellite
        was the one behind triggering an entire race to reach for the cosmos, in the first time ever in history.

        Sputnik was launched on the "8K71PS", a derivative of the R-7, which was an ICBM originally designed as a weapon aimed towards
        the USA during the cold war. 
        <br><br>
        After a ten-minute launch into orbit, the Sputnik finally became the first man-made satellite to orbit the Earth - and this proved the fact
        that orbit could be achieved - which led the way onto the next crucial step - putting the first man in space.

        The launch of Sputnik took everyone by surprise - however none more so than it's direct rival - the United States of America. The USA had not been anticipating the USSR to have
        orbital technology this early in the game. Because of Sputnik, the US space industry had to shift into overdrive. Various rockets, ICBMs, guidance systems and human workforces were put into the 
        overdrive so that they could achieve the next objective - putting a human in orbit.
        <br><br>
        For this, they chose the <i>Mercury Seven</i>, a group of highly talented aviators from various walks of life to fly into space. Life and training proceeded, and out of the seven,
        Alan Shepard was the one who got selected. He was to fly onboard the <i>Mercury-Redstone 1</i>, NASA's rocket for putting humans into space.

        However, various budget overruns, delays, safety management and other logistical challenges proved that NASA was still not yet ready at the whole to compete with the USSR on the space frontier. Yuri Gagarin, launching just
        a month prior to Alan Shepard, managed to become the first human in space, and the first one to orbit the entire Earth.

        Mercury came and went, with it's own special set of problems that NASA solved and learned from. However, the Soviets had beaten them again - this time, by hosting the first spacewalk
        to happen in Earth orbit, which was done by Alexei Leonov. This meant that the only chance the USA could one-up them - was by getting two spacecraft, in orbit, to come together
        and rendezvous - which the Soviets had not done till yet.
        <br><br>
        There was also another factor - the eventual Lunar mission would require a way to get the astronauts to the surface, and then back. A single ship - landing and then taking off was too dangerous,
        so the logical answer came down to rendezvous - breaking off the ship in two parts - one a lander, and one a mothership, which reunited back when the astronauts had to go home. However,
        this meant that before they could try it in Lunar orbit, they had to learn that in the Earth's influence. And thus Gemini was born.

        As Gemini progressed, it was time to move on - NASA had learned, and they had dreamed - now it was time to move onto Apollo, and if done correctly, man would land on it's natural satellite
        by the end of 1967, for the first time in human history.

        Morale was high and the crew of the Apollo 1 were supposed to only go in for a routine ground test. However on one January 27, 1967, the fate 
        of the Apollo program was irreversibly changed - what was supposed to be a routine ground test ended up taking the lives of the entire crew - because of a 
        a fire that started in the command module - their capsule - which could not be put out, and because their door opened inwards, they were unable to open the door. 
        <br><br>
        The deaths of the three prime astronauts came as a shock - both emotionally and as a whole agency. A NASA review board found a stray spark (probably from damaged wires near Grissom's couch) started the fire in the pure oxygen environment. 
        Fed by flammable features such as nylon netting and foam pads, the blaze quickly spread. Apollo was on the brink of being cancelled - however, after 18 months of no progress, NASA was finally
        given a tentative go to resume operations with Apollo 4, this time a test flight article, with no humans. A new command module, called the "Block II" was also in development.

        With time, NASA successfully completed the test missions - Apollo 4(unmanned command module, to display safety), Apollo 5(unmanned lunar module test), Apollo 6(final unmanned test flight), and 
        finally Apollo 7 - the first manned flight of the new Block II command module, this time in Earth orbit - completing all it's mission criteria successfully. It was time to reach higher heights.

        With the success of the Apollo 7 flight, NASA had decided that they needed another flight in low earth orbit to verify the safety of the new command module for sure. However, 
        that plan was discarded in the favour of a newer, more bolder mission - going to the Moon - and staying and testing the command module there, in it's orbit. This was fueled by both the 
        Soviets developing their own Zond missions which would take a man to orbit the moon, and time criticality - President John F Kennedy, in 1962 before he died - had set a challenge that the USA would put
        a man on the moon and bring him back safely by the end of the decade, saying "We chose to go the Moon - not because it is easy, but because it is hard." And following that same spirit, astronauts 
        James Lovell, Frank Borman and Bill Anders packed their bags towards the Moon.
        <br><br>
        In addition to being the first mission to Lunar orbit, it was also supposed to be the first of the Saturn V - the mighty vehicle, developed by Werner von Braun(who earlier worked on the V-2 missile) which was
        supposed to take men to the Moon.

        Apollo 10 marked the first time the lunar module had been used in Lunar orbit. It had been tested and successfully verified on an earlier flight - Apollo 9 - however it had not been tested in the Lunar environment, 
        which was significantly more harsh than Earth. The main goal of Apollo 10 was to do everything that Apollo 11 would do - the moon landing mission - except the landing, as a dress rehearsal so that Apollo 11 astronauts would know
        what to expect when they got there. Apollo 10 crew had to verify the lunar module and command module interactions, computers, engines, and life support systems.
        <br><br>
        The flight also encountered one or two issues during their flight - one of which was almost life threatening. While testing the separation of the lower stage of the lunar module, the lunar module almost tumbled out of control
        and caused the guidance systems inside the craft to error out. However the astronauts, who were highly trained and calm, managed to take control and get the lunar module back to the command module.

        The hour of reckoning had come. After a three day cruise to the Moon by launching on July 16 1969, the lunar module, nicknamed <i>"Eagle"</i>, separated from <i>"Columbia"</i>, the command module. 
        After a 15 minute descent down to the Lunar surface, riddled with computer malfunctions(the computer crashed 5 times), guidance problems(the computer was taking them into a crater), fuel issues(they only had enough fuel for another 20 seconds or so before they had to abort the landing), somehow man, for the first time in

        After getting out from the lunar module, Neil Armstrong uttered the words which were etched into history forever. Buzz Aldrin, looked at the Lunar surface and said two words, which fit the Moon down to every syllable - <i>"magnificent desolation"</i>.

        After a 23 hour stay on the Lunar surface, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin lifted back off of the lunar surface in their lunar module, and met back with <i>Columbia</i>, still piloted by Michael Collins.

    After the Apollo 11 debacle, six more missions went to the Moon - 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Out of these, Apollo 13 never landed, because it's command module experienced a failure due to a mid-flight explosion. Apollo 15, 16 and 17 spent more time on the Moon than anyone else due to their improved stay-time and better equipment and rovers. Apollo 12 became the only mission to
    survive a lightning attack twice during liftoff.
